            ### Why Does this Happen?

            * Poor estimation of work
            * Feature creep

            * Fear to ship

            ####  Minimum Viable Product

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
I'm sure most of you know what an MVP is, but its definition bears repeating.
">
            ### A Definition

            > Smallest thing you can build that gets the product out to customers
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
It's an optimisation problem.

You want to maximise the learning the product gives you, whilst minimising the
resource costs.
">
            ## Goal

            **Maximise** learning about the users and problem domain

            **Minimise** resources spent
          </section>

          <section data-notes="
Some definitions would consider paper prototypes and mock ups MVPs. After all,
you can learn about the problem domain and users that way.

In this talk however, we use a stricter definition. We define an MVP as the
smallest product that can be shipped to users and immediately provide reals value.

Something that we build and ship to the intended users.

          <section data-background="images/startupbus_working2.jpg" data-notes="
One problem we often have with StartupBus events in making sure that each team
are on track, and are prioriting the right tasks.

We have multiple buses, or hackathons, running at the same time.

Each bus has many teams, all of which are multi-disciplinary. There's developers,
designers and biz dev people.

Making sure each team on every bus is on track is a logistical nightmare.

We don't want to constantly check up on teams and micro-manage them. They've got
a lot to do and not a lot of time to do.

Our solution?
">
          </section>

          <section data-background="images/trello_board.png" data-notes="
We provide each team with a Trello board.

The board contains high-level tasks, or milestones, the team's should strive to reach.

We've found it to be an effective way of getting a team to prioritise getting an MVP out the door and shipped to customers.

          <section data-markdown>
            ### The Problem

            Teams are:

            * distributed across multiple locations
            * multi-disciplined
            * managed by different people
            * busy
          </section>

          <section data-notes="
Trello doesn't support aggregated statistics on boards out of the box.

Having one of the directors constantly inspect the Trello boards of 30 or more
teams is time-consuming and wasteful.

It doesn't really solve the problem.

            ### One Step Further

            Growth in decentralised, distributed teams

            Self-managed teams with shallow hierarchy

            Multi-disciplinary teams that use specialised tracking software
          </section>

          <section data-markdown data-notes="
I've worked for multiple large enterprises.

I've seen first hand just how much money senior managers are willing to pay to
reduce complex project metrics into pretty looking progress bars.

Large projects require lots of software lots of software to track them. So why
not consolidate all that information in one place?

Provide cheaper solution for smaller, distributed companies that need to track
complex, multi-disciplinary projects as well.

Follow the rule of one.

We want our MVP to test the assumption that people have a need to view overviews
of project progress that are not produced by existing tools.

Any features, integrations outside not related to testing that assumption will
be ignored.

You focus on one pain point for the MVP. You have tunnel vision -- you live and
breathe that pain point, it's all you think about.

            ### The MVP
            #### Follow the Rule of One

            * **One** user type
            * **One** use case
            * **One** industry
            * **One** core feature
            * **One** very specific problem

          <section data-notes="
So what pain point are we going to focus on for this talk?

Mine.

Personally, I find that the best way to build products. Solve your own problems,
and then see if those solutions apply to others.

Follow the Rule One

Store as little data as possible too. For example, why not store more user info

              - Google and Programmable Web are your friends
            * You want to write as little code as possible
            * Store as little data as possible
