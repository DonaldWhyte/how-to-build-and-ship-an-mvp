          <section data-notes="
Some definitions would consider paper prototypes and mock ups MVPs. After all,
you can learn about the problem domain and users that way.

In this talk however, we're a little stricter on our definition. We're going to
be defining an MVP as one the smallest product that can be shipped to users and
imemdiately provide real value.

Something we can build and ship.

One problem we often have with StartupBus events in making sure that each team
are on track, and are prioriting the right tasks.

We have multiple buses, or hackathons, running at the same time.

Each bus has many teams, all of which are multi-disciplinary. There's developers,
designers and biz dev people.

Making sure each team on every bus is on track is a logistical nightmare.

We don't want to constantly check up on teams and micro-manage them. They've got
a lot to do and not a lot of time to do.

Our solution?

We provide each team with a Trello board.

The board contains high-level tasks, or milestones, the team's should strive to reach.

            ### The Problem

            Teams are:

            * distributed across multiple locations
            * multi-disciplined
            * managed by different people

          <section data-notes="
Trello doesn't support aggregated statistics on boards out of the box.

Having one of the directors constantly inspect the Trello boards of 30 or more
teams is time-consuming and wasteful.

It doesn't really solve the problem.

Follow the rule of one.

We want our MVP to test the assumption that people have a need to view overviews
of project progress that are not produced by existing tools.

Any features, integrations outside not related to testing that assumption will
be ignored.

You focus on one pain point for the MVP. You have tunnel vision -- you live and
breathe that pain point, it's all you think about.
